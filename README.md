# :tv: Twitch M:tG Legacy Finder


## :memo: Description
Do you like watching Magic: the Gathing streams on Twitch.tv? Specifically streams of the Legacy format?

So do I! And that's why i built this tool. Since Arena became a popular way for Magic players to stream Magic, I have a hard time filtering out all the arena and modern streams on Twitch.

This website shows only the live M:tG streams with `legacy` in the title.

## Why do I need to login to Twitch?

Since this is a client side application, Twitch's API requires an access token in order to access certain endpoints. I wanted to avoid writing a server for this little project, so you'll need to login. Sorry for any inconvienence.
